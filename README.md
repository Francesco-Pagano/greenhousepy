# greenhousepy
_greenhousepy_ is a system to manage a small greenhouse with just a plant inside. First of all, a soil moisture sensor is used to measure the soil moisture level of the plant. Based on the soil moisture level, a sprinkler is turned on/off. _greenhousepy_ also checks if there is too much light inside the greenhouse through a photoresistor; if so, it turns on a red smart lightbulb.

To recap, the system includes the following sensors and actuators:
* A soil moisture sensor;
* A sprinkler;
* A photoresistor;
* A red smart lightbulb.

The communication between the main board and the other components happens through GPIO pins. The communication is already configured in the BOARD mode (i.e., GPIO pins are referred to by their physical number on the board).

## Instructions for You
* FORK this project and make sure your forked repository is PUBLIC. Then, IMPORT the forked project into PyCharm.
* You are asked to develop _greenhousepy_ by following TDD with the support of GAI4-TDD.
* You DO NOT need to develop a GUI.
* You CANNOT change the signature of the provided methods, move the provided methods to other classes, or change the name of the provided classes. However, you CAN add fields, methods (e.g., methods used by tests to set up the fixture or methods used by the provided methods), or even classes (including other test classes), as long as you comply with the provided API.
* You CAN use the internet to consult Python APIs or QA sites (e.g., StackOverflow).
* You CANNOT use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) except for GAI4-TDD.
* You CANNOT interact with your colleagues. Work alone and do your best!
* The _greenhousepy_ requirements are divided into a set of USER STORIES, which serve as a to-do list (see the _Issues_ session).
* You should be able to incrementally develop _greenhousepy_ without an upfront comprehension of all its requirements. DO NOT read ahead, and handle the requirements (i.e., specified in the user stories) one at a time in the provided order. Develop _greenhousepy_ by starting from the first storyâ€™s requirement. When a story is IMPLEMENTED, move on to the NEXT one. A story is implemented when you are confident that your program correctly implements the functionality stipulated by the story's requirement. This implies that all your test cases for that story and all the test cases for the previous stories pass. You may need to review your program as you progress toward more advanced requirements.
Each time you end a TDD phase, COMMIT.
If you need to handle error situations (including situations unspecified by the user stories), throw a ```GreenhouseError```.

## API Usage
Take some minutes to understand, in broad terms, how the API works (i.e., see the provided classes). If you do not fully understand the API, do not worry because further details will be given in the user stories (see the _Issues_ session).
